For some reason program cannot import items from
finalmap, so I copy pasted the code into
map.py.

I'm not really sure if the program will work without either files,
so just don't delete anything lol.

But if you want to make changes to the map or items,
make changes to map.py and finalItems.py respectively.

TO-DO:
1) Locks(one door)
2) Shop
3) Alley Boss(done)
4) Endings(draft)
5) Bacon trick
6) sell laptop
7) optional: Colored text to make things more readable.
8) using items

*You can add more things here if we missed something!
